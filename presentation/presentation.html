# Job Opportunities

# Agenda

1. What is Active Job?
2. What are its shortcomings?
3. What's the solution?

---

# What is Active Job?

* Introduced in Rails 4.2
* Abstraction layer for background processing

---

# The Problems with Active Job

* Configurable Retry
* Tightly Coupled to Rails

---

# These Jobs Never Retry

```ruby
class ActiveNeverRetry < ApplicationJob
  queue_as :default

  rescue_from(StandardError) do |exception|
    Rails.logger.error "Job failed: #{exception.message}"
  end

  def perform
    raise 'Failure'
  end
end
```

```ruby
class DelayedNeverRetry
  def perform
    raise 'Failure'
  end

  def max_attempts
    1
  end

  def failure(job)
    Rails.logger.error "Job failed: #{job.last_error.each_line.first}"
  end
end
```

---

# This Job Retries Exactly Twice

```ruby
Delayed::Worker.max_attempts = 3
```

```ruby
class ActiveThreeTries < ApplicationJob
  queue_as :default

  def perform
    raise 'Failure'
  end
end
```

* All other jobs must never retry or use the same retry policy

---

# This Job Retries Exactly Three Times

```ruby
class DelayedFourTries
  def perform
    raise 'Failure'
  end

  def max_attempts
    4
  end
end
```

* Each job can define its own retry policy

---

# Coupling

```ruby
class DelayedFanoutJob
  def initialize(count:, queue:)
    @count = count
    @queue = queue
  end

  def perform
    @count.times.each do |i|
      @queue.enqueue(DelayedChildJob.new(i))
    end
  end

  def max_attempts
    1
  end
end
```

* Active Job does not split the job queue and the job definition into separate classes/responsibilities
* Difficult to write tests that don't reference Active Job

---

# The Good Parts

* GlobalID: https://github.com/rails/globalid

---

# TL;DR

Consider using your background job processing framework of choice rather than Active Job, especially if you are doing more complicated processing.
